My personal motto is Never Stop Learning. The world never stands still, and there is always something new to learn and explore. This is what drives me, and I hope to share with you some of the things that I have learned. One of the most important lessons in Tech is that everything changes. Really the only thing that is constant is that nothing is constant. What is relevant today will be laughable in five years. To be successful you need to be flexible and be curious.
